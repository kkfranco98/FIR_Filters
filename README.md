# FIR\_Filters

![PlatformIO](https://img.shields.io/badge/PlatformIO-Compatible-orange) ![Arduino](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arduino-Compatible-blue)

A lightweight and flexible FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter library for microcontrollers, with support for signal filtering and derivative calculation (instantaneous and average). Designed for real-time data acquisition applications such as sensor smoothing and signal analysis.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

* Circular FIR filtering with customizable coefficients
* Automatic time unit conversion (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds)
* Instantaneous derivative calculation using timestamps
* Average derivative calculation
* Compatible with both `float` and `double` types
* Ready-to-use on Arduino and PlatformIO

## ðŸ“š Usage

See examples in the repository folder or run on microcontroller

## ðŸ¥ª Examples

### 1. How to use the filter

See: [`examples/how_to_use.ino`](examples/how_to_use.ino)
Basic demonstration of filter configuration and usage.

### 2. Filtering sensor data

See: [`examples/filter_data_from_sensor.ino`](examples/filter_data_from_sensor.ino)
Use case where noisy temperature data is filtered using a low-pass FIR filter.

### 4. FIR on signals

See: [`examples/signals_example_with_post_multiplication.ino`](examples/signals_example_with_post_multiplication.ino)
Demonstrates how the filter reacts to sine/triangle waves and how the output changes depending on the coefficients.
